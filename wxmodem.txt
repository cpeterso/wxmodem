  This set of files is a sample WXmodem program for the TCOMM demo
  BBS system.  It is public domain.

  The program is executed from a .BAT file as follows:

  WXMODEM %1 W PCJR

     %1       Filename of parameter/control file
     W/C/X    W for windowed xmodem, C for CRC Xmodem, X for checksum
     PCJR     Optional, only if TCOMM BBS is run on a PC Junior

  WXMODEM looks for the following information in the parameter/control
  file:

  [S/R] filename [port] [baud] [parity]

     [S/R]    Send or Receive
     filename To be sent or received
     [port]   Either COM1 or COM2
     [baud]   Any number over 0 and less than or equal to 9600
     [parity] Supports EVEN and NONE.  Only checks the first letter.
	      If EVEN then it assumes 7 data bits.  If None, it assumes
	      8 data bits. Assumes 1 stop bit.

   In all cases, the parity, baud rate and stop bits are restored
   to what they were prior to invoking the program.

   At initialization time, WXMODEM will send a message out the line
   indicating filenames, abort sequence, time estimate and block counts.

   Please let me know how it works.
